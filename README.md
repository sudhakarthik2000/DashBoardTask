# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



Make sure you have the following installed on your system:



step1: copy paste my github url in terminal  clone my code...
step2:npm create vite@latest my-vite-project
step3:npm install
step4:npm run dev
------------


Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager) 
You can download and install Node.js from here.

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sudhakarthik2000/DashboardTask
cd DashboardTask



3. Install Dependencies
Once you are inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies. Run one of the following commands:

Using npm:


npm install


4. Run the Application
After the dependencies are installed, you can run the application locally.

Using npm:

Using Vite.
npm run dev
-----



You can now view your-app-name in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000

5. Open the Application in Your Browser
After running the command above, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
You should see the React dashboard application running locally.
6. Making Changes
If you make any changes to the code, the development server will automatically reload, and you will see the updates in the browser.
7. Stopping the Server
To stop the development server, press Ctrl + C in your terminal or command prompt.




#  To Run  the application
npm start
These steps should get the application running locally. If you encounter any issues, make sure all dependencies are installed correctly, and your environment meets the prerequisites. Let me know if you need further assistance!
